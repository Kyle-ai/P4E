#Assume we execute the following assingment statements:
#width = 17
#height =  12.0

#For each of the following expressions write the value of the expression and
#the type(of the value of the expression)
#1.width//2  answer= class 'int'
#2.width/2.0 answer= class 'float'
#3.height/3
#4.1+2*5

first = 17//2 answer = class 'int'
second = 17/2 answer = class 'float'
third =12/3 answer = class 'float'
fourth = 1+2*5 answer = class 'int'
